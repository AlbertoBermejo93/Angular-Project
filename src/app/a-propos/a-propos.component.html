      <h3>Beer's origins</h3>

      <p>Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third
        most popular drink overall after water and tea. It is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches,
        mainly derived from cereal grains most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats
        are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and
        carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other
        flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs,
        or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is
        often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.
        <br><br>
        Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of
        Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
        Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a
        culture with few literate people.</p>
